# **Final Project Proposal**

## **Project Description**

### What is the dataset you'll be working with?
> *We chose to work on a drug abuse dataset. The data and information was recorded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, whose goal is to advance addiction science. The dataset was most recently edited in January of 2019. The data was drawn from reports done by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that concerns commonly used drugs, overdose rates, demographics, deaths, and so on.*  

### Who is your target audience?
> *Our target audience is people ages 15 through 25 who are more likely to be experimenting with drugs(highschool - college).*

### What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.
> - *What are the average overdose rates for each specific drug?
- How has drug use changed throughout large metropolitan areas, medium-small metropolitan areas, and non-metropolitan areas since 1999?
- Which drugs cause the highest rate of overdose in the 15-24 age group within the different genders?
- Is there growth or decline in each of the ethnicities(African American, Hispanic, white) from 1999 to 2017.*


## **Technical Description**

### How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?
> *Our data is an excel sheet, so we will be converting it to a .csv file.*

### What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
> *We need to extract data on specific drugs we want to talk about*

### What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
> *Shiny, ggplot*

### What major challenges do you anticipate?
> *We think it may be difficult to use shiny*
